### Coinbase for voter rewards

Validators can reward voters for their vote, and have full freedom to set that up however they want (as long as it works with the Election.sol interface for it, i.e., users vote via a contract the validator set up and has registered as their voter reward manager contract. ) The system is very flexible and modular. The two most basic categories of voter reward schemes is to send voter reward to the voter who elected validator, or, distribute on all voters during a period. Here, a version of each of these cateogies is provided. Also note, part of the reward goes to validator (unless they choose to give everything to voters. )
